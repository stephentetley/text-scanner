# text-scanner - obsolete

Now obsolete... the alternative project FlixParsec is now fast enough for "real world" use.

Old readme...

Experimental parser / scanner combinator library for Flix based on `java.util.Scanner`.

This was an experiment to see what sort of a library we can get with `java.util.Scanner` as it
has no support for backtracking and only allows lookahead of a single token.

Note - depends on `flix-sandbox`.
